 we are going to start to make a simple snake game as a project to learn the basics of c++ 
we'll be using dev c++ to code our game
so now here we go
to make a game basically we need 4 raw functions that are 
1.setup
2.draw
3.input
4.logic
besides all these functions we'll need to code the basic function ; main function
we'll be coding each and every function one by one
we'll declare a boolean variable named "gameover". as its name this variable will be used as the trigger button adn will determine when to stop and start the game
then we need to set the dimentions of the map in snake game
just like height and widh of the box
and also we have to set the dimentions of the head of the snake and of the fruit
and to indicate score there is also a score variable
after all this we need to track the direction of the snake so that we can configure its controls loke if we press A it goes left but it should go continuosly toward left we need not to press A multiple times
we need to use enumerations to do this
as i don't know much about this i'll study this 
enum command is used to declare enuerations 
Enum is a user defined data type where we specify a set of values for a variable and the variable can only take one out of a small set of possible values
the in setup function we need to declare the starting pint of the snake head i want to stat the game with snake head at the centre of the map so i will give set it as haf of width and half of height
then i will give the dimentions of the fruit spawning by the randomcomand using rand()
and at starting i will set the score as 0
